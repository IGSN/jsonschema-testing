# IGSN metadata #
Metadata in IGSN are handled in two separate streams, one for the registration of identifiers and one for the description of samples. This sub-repository is for the development of the IGSN registration metadata schema.
The main registration service handles requests based on the registration schema, version 1.0.
The registration metadata schema development is documented in the [repository wiki](https://github.com/IGSN/metadata/wiki)

Please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/IGSN/metadata/issues) for bugs, feature requests, etc.
